They gave us a complimentary upgrade on arrival which was lovely. The food was delicious, the selection at breakfast was amazing, tea/coffee made to order and served to the table(this was a fab touch, given that coffee is a huge thing these days around the globe!) We dined in sofritos, the bar at the pool and the lounge in the hotel, we loved the lounge very chill which is more our vibe to formal dining and the bao buns, salad and desserts were so good! I would have loved to try the Asian restaurant too but my husband is a very plain eater so don’t think that would work, but it looked stunning! The pool is just wow here, the views etc were stunning. They also have an indoor pool too, spa and gym we didn’t use these but heard very good things about these too. The hotel is up on a height so hence the stunning views but still no issue with this as the staff have a golf cart that they can bring you down to the main gate(they can’t bring you past this as the golf cart has no plate so it’s about half way down) but we used to love the walk as very close to benitses village so we used to stroll down to there too, has a path the whole way bit of a work out walking back up the hill but again once you reach the main gate the golf cart will pick you up and bring you back and no harm as all the over indulging of food!!😝 Room was lovely and clean, serviced twice a day, has a mini fridge(handy to store water, they provide plenty of bottled water also) The hotel was spotless throughout. They also can organize a taxi for you €40 to old town, we also went to Mesonghi one evening and the taxi was €35 to here, if you hire a car the staff will park it and bring it to you when required. Would deffo stay here again and recommend it to a friend. Thanks for a fab trip, enjoy your break for the off season well deserved to all the staff.🥰","time":"2 months ago"},{"author":"Victoria","rating":5,"text":"I stayed at this hotel for the second time and it was just as fabulous as I remembered. The staff are so professional and friendly. Thank you to the lovely guy who drove us to and from the beach every day 😊.

We had an incredible three-course dinner at Sofrito which included king prawns and ceviche, and even the beach restaurant was fantastic - the grilled octopus tacos were out of this world.\n\nI also had a wonderful massage; both the masseuse and the spa receptionist were so kind and made me feel completely relaxed.\n\nI can’t wait to come back!","time":"2 months ago"},{"author":"Open Kloset By Karina","rating":5,"text":"Dive into Corfu’s Eclectic Spirit 🌿🌊🇬🇷\nwe spent an unforgettable day at this resort,  enjoying a serene spa escape and a delicious lunch with breathtaking Ionian Sea views.\n\nPerched on a lush hill above the turquoise waters, this 5⭐️ resort — the first banyantreehotels property in Europe — perfectly blends authentic Greek hospitality with Asian-inspired serenity.\n\nFrom elegant suites and private villas to the world-class wellness center and seafront dining, every detail captures the soul of Corfu.

We had the pleasure of staying here last week and were absolutely stunned by everything this resort had to offer. The resort’s infrastructure is superb; the way the infinity pool seems to flow seamlessly into the deep blue far-stretching Ionian Sea is simply breathtaking. The staff were exceptional as well: always smiling, welcoming, and ready to assist with anything we needed. The on-site dining options were also fantastic.

Beautiful hotel, beautiful location and grounds were well kept. The ambience is unmatched. The one big issue I had was we had sent some laundry off with housekeeping, and one of the items I sent was a favorite blouse. We filled out the paperwork correctly describing the items we sent to be cleaned, however, when we got them back the next day my blouse was missing. We kept following up with them for the remainder of the trip asking if they had found it…by the end of it, they finally acknowledged they couldn’t locate it. The blouse was not terribly expensive (around $55) but it was a favorite and it is not replaceable. Not to mention, for a 5 star resort to not offer any compensation or resolution was very upsetting.  To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. If you stay here, I do not suggest using the laundry services (or at least not sending anything valuable). Besides that, the service at the restaurants was great and the food was very good.","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"Maria Markou","rating":5,"text":"Everything was perfect!!

The pool area is stunning, and the whole experience felt luxurious yet grounded in nature and history.\n\nThe only small suggestion we’d make is around guest orientation. The property is large and full of interesting areas and activities, but we weren’t given a proper briefing on arrival. The person who took us to reception offered little detail. We ended up missing some of the lovely complimentary activities like the bread making and honey collecting, which mostly happen on weekends but managed to do a garden tour with the agronomist which was special.\n\nA simple welcome tour or clearer communication would make a big difference.\n\nThat aside, our stay was exceptional — peaceful, delicious, and full of charm.

To the point, following a glorious 5 days we departed Amanzoe for the next leg of our Greek itinerary and within 36 hours, I had rehired the private helicopter service to take us back. We literally abandoned the remaining prepaid portion of our Greek trip to spend more time at Amanzoe.

Costa Navarino was simply incredible. We had a beautiful room with a private pool, where we spent countless relaxing moments soaking up the sun in total privacy. We enjoyed the stunning pools throughout the resort, tried the jacuzzis, and treated ourselves to a wonderful spa experience that left us completely refreshed. We also had a great time playing tennis on their perfectly maintained courts. Every meal was exceptional — full of amazing flavors and fresh, high-quality ingredients. Above all, the staff made us feel truly welcome; everyone was so friendly, warm, and attentive, always ready to help with a genuine smile.

I actually needed to beg to get a place. On 2 evenings we needed to go outside the hotel or order a room service.\nDuring morning breakfast we had some rain (something that was expected if you watch the weather forecast). We needed to travel on an open hotel car for about 10 minutes in order to get breakfast in another hotel next by.\nInternet access is simply not working. Unless i paid 10 euro per day - I was unable to get internet signal.\n\nI shared that with the guest relations and had some emails going back and forth but they did not really compensate us for a bad vacation\nAll they offered is an apology and points on the Marriott application.\nFor a 1000 euro per night, I think we all deserve better.","time":"2 months ago"},{"author":"Ran Ben-David","rating":5,"text":"What a wonderful stay! I recently visited this amazing resort and had a fantastic time. The place is absolutely gorgeous, and I was impressed by the variety of rooms, some even coming with their own private pools.\nThe breakfast was a major highlight. There was a huge variety of delicious food and desserts, ensuring there was something for everyone.\nThe resort has plenty of fun activities to offer. The water slides were a blast, and the kids'' pools were perfect for the little ones. I also enjoyed relaxing at the spa and getting a workout in at the gym. There were so many swimming pools to choose from, each with plenty of seating and towels readily available.\nThe beach was truly incredible—clean, peaceful, and stunning. They also had towels, a kiosk, and a friendly staff there to help.\nEven though the resort is huge, getting around was super easy thanks to the convenient shuttles. The entire staff was incredibly kind and helpful throughout my stay.\nMy only minor complaint is the lack of drinking water,\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this resort. It''s a truly wonderful place for a relaxing and fun vacation.","time":"4 months ago"},{"author":"danae","rating":2,"text":"Exhorbitant prices while getting a service that you can easily find it for at least 60% less in other more beautiful parts of Greece (especially quality of food, spa services). I found it a disgrace from this perspective. They even asked for 8000 euros pre authorisation for 4 nights stay. I thought I would be walking in a paradise on earth: far from it. Coming from Kinsterna boutique luxury hotel, our rooms  and experience was a bit of a let down.\n\nMost of activities you need to pay for. When the basic bill is quite steep, this seems a bit excessive.\n\nAlso I might add it s the first time I have had to pay for the entire stay upon check-in. And if I may they have been a bit pushy and seemed a bit worried we were trespassing. After 2 days stay they seemed more relaxed as they saw we have been spending in the hotel and let us charge the room etc. This has never happened to me before.\n\nThe area is nice if you visit from abroad and haven''t been much around in Greece. For people that know, the entire area is just \"bof\" (=\"meh\"). Beach not exactly a highlight.\nIn Peloponesse, there are nicer beaches and places to stay in the south of the region (e.g. around Monemvasia, Mani etc). And many other wonderful regions to visit in Greece much better than Costa Navarino.","time":"5 months ago"},{"author":"Isabella Marie","rating":5,"text":"We recently stayed at this beautiful resort and were truly impressed by how lovely and well maintained everything was. From the moment we arrived, the atmosphere felt peaceful, relaxing, and safe exactly what you''d hope for when looking to unplug and recharge.\nOne of the best parts about this resort is the convenience. Everything is within walking or buggy distance whether it''s the beach, pools, restaurants, or activities. It makes exploring the property easy and enjoyable without ever feeling like you''re rushing from place to place.\nThere are multiple dining options and plenty of activities to choose from, whether you''re looking to stay active or just unwind. From lounging in the sun to enjoying fun excursions, there''s something for everyone. The staff has been nothing but warm, helpful, and accommodating throughout our stay. Their hospitality truly added to the experience.\nWhile there were a couple of small hiccups mostly around needing reservations for certain experiences those could’ve been easily avoided had we known in advance. Still, they didn’t take away from the overall experience.\nWe highly recommend this resort to couples, families with kids, or anyone just looking to get away for a bit.

The gym is well equipped and more than sufficient for a holiday workout.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that the overall atmosphere of the hotel is very quiet and, at times, a bit too calm.

It was also obvious that since the hotel was about to close for the season, service had dropped to a bare minimum, even the bar didnot have fresh fruits to serve. Only the parking team and the breakfast staff seemed to make an effort — everything else was far below standard.\n\nFor the amount we paid ( almost 953€ for 2 nights )the service and quality were absolutely not worth it.

Thank you for a memorable and flawless holiday Nikki Beach beach resort and spa Porto heli .","time":"4 months ago"},{"author":"Hamza Debbarh","rating":4,"text":"Very nice hotel with fantastic view on the marina and generous size of the room with large bathroom and more than enough space for a family of three or even four and a fantastic view from the terrace / balcony on Porto Heli Marina. Good buffet for a boutique hotel, the dinner at the dolce vita was very good as well with a fantastic sunset view. The beach unfortunately is not clean (too much seaweed…), doesn’t seem to be  swimmable but the pool is nice and has great views on the marina. Overall, I would say one of the best spots in Porto Heli to discover and explore the area with fantastic experiences of yachting and swimming in very unexpected and beautiful places. We definitely recommend.","time":"4 months ago"}]'::jsonb,

Ktima on 14.10.25\nI can honestly say it was the best day of both our lives. Everybody that works at Ktima are friendly & went above & beyond to make ours & our guests experience unforgettable!\nThe food is exceptional, the views are breathtaking.\nI would especially like to thank both Nicole our wedding planner & Manolis the owner of Ktima for all their assistance in making our dream wedding come true ❤️","time":"2 months ago"},{"author":"Viktor Miljesic","rating":1,"text":"I rarely write negative reviews, but my experience at Ktima Lindos was disappointing enough that I feel it’s worth sharing. We ordered steaks medium, and they came out completely overcooked—not once, but twice. Despite giving them a second chance, the kitchen still couldn’t get it right. To make things worse, no refund or compensation was offered, just a shrug.\n\nThe only redeeming factor here is the view, which is admittedly beautiful—but if you actually care about good food and service, stay away. Lindos has plenty of other restaurants that deliver both.","time":"4 months ago"},{"author":"Georgina Tseroni","rating":5,"text":"I had such a wonderful experience here! The cocktails were amazing, but the food was even more impressive. The view is truly remarkable, the kind you just don’t forget, and the team working there were so kind and helpful, making the whole evening even better. This place is definitely a must-stop when in Rhodes, and I’d absolutely go back again. Highly recommend!","time":"4 months ago"},{"author":"Rob Parfitt","rating":5,"text":"An unforgettable experience at Ktima, Lindos.\n\nFrom start to finish, dining at Ktima was an absolute highlight of our trip. The setting is truly one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever had a meal, with breathtaking views paired with a serene atmosphere that makes the whole experience feel special.\n\nThe service was exceptional across the board. Every member of staff struck the perfect balance, attentive without ever being pushy or interruptive. What seemed to be the head lady was simply amazing: warm, professional, and clearly passionate about making guests feel welcome. Toward the end of our meal, another member of the team, possibly a manager, came over to take payment. Rather than just processing the bill and moving on, he took the time to ask where we were from, where we were staying, and even offered thoughtful recommendations for other restaurants to try. It was a genuinely refreshing interaction that showed they care more about your experience than just your custom.\n\nThe food was phenomenal. The seafood linguine, in particular, deserves a special mention. It was hands down the best bowl of pasta I’ve ever eaten. Every bite was packed with flavour, and it was cooked to perfection. The cocktails were also excellent, beautifully made and perfectly balanced.\n\nOn top of everything, the service was fast and efficient without feeling rushed. Ktima gets everything right, from location and ambiance to food and hospitality. If you’re in Lindos, do not miss this place.","time":"6 months ago"},{"author":"Billy Gray","rating":5,"text":"We''ve been to this place a few times now and it never disappoints. The food is always amazing, the drinks are spot on, and the views are unreal. The staff are super attentive and friendly — you really feel looked after.

So only stay here if you do not want to leave the resort.\n\nDrying clean laundry on dusty rocks was disturbing. Reading lights flashed. Frayed wires on lights. Rust on the pool. Trash and missing vent covers.\n\nAttached to another resort that had constant flows of your buses. Also the visitors there kept trying to get into the gym and other areas of Acro suites.\n\nWe honestly just expected more. Sunrises were nice.

The park, facilities and swimming pools are well designed and the resort feels elegant and personal. The staff of the hotel in the different departments are warm, interested and treat you as family. The hotel breaths a chic and authentic atmosphere with beautiful materials used, plants and palm trees. There is a good mix guests and people greet each other. Not too many children around the pool so we could do our daily swim easily and the gym had enough machines and fitness equipment to do a good work-out. The newer big size pool is perfect for swimming laps and 1.40 meter deep.\n\nWeekly there are different events, our favorite is the Greek evening with traditional Cretan dishes and dancing. In the setting with the church it feels you are in a small local village square.\n\nWe stayed many times in the suite with private pool, the suite is spacious and very private. The pool is big enough to refresh and swim a bit or drink a wine along it. We like the showers and bath amenities and slept really well.\n\nThere are not many places in Crete with a complete product like the St. Nicolas Bay hotel with private beach, parking and different restaurant facilities. Mostly we eat in the different restaurants and did not take the half board plan but this is also possible. We like also to visit the town of Agios Nikolaos for the other nights, easy acces and taxi for 8 euro.\n\nWe will definitely be back!! Thank you for al the great moments so far.\n\nSome tips to visit: Voulisma Beach and the beach club there to have lunch, The town of Agios Nikolaos day time or evening and Ammoudi Beach.","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"Keith Vartanian (Keith Vartanian)","rating":5,"text":"We were here for the tail end of our honeymoon, and when I say this was the best stay that myself or my wife have ever had, I mean it.\n\nFrom the moment we got there we were treated like family - everyone knew our names, greeted us with joy and went above and beyond to ask us if we need anything.\n\nMy wife has a gluten allergy, and from day one, whether it was breakfast, lunch, or dinner, they knew to bring over gluten free bread for her, and had the chef come out and talk to her about what she could and could not have.\n\nFor our final night, they offered to move us to an upgraded room as an extension of warmth for our honeymoon - unfortunately we had to decline as it meant packing up early on a day we had an excursion planned. So, instead, they surprised us with a dinner on the house at their finest restaurant, and gave us the best seat in the house to look out at the sunset over the bay. This included a full meal, as well as a bottle of champagne. Everyone on staff was warm and asked us about our wedding, gave us personal stories, etc.\n\nAll this to say this place has the service of a 5 star stay, and the personality of a local bed and breakfast. Well-done to all involved, we never like to return to hotels but we both have agreed that we plan on coming back here as often as we can afford 😂","time":"4 months ago"},{"author":"NIKOS-REVAZ NEBADZE","rating":5,"text":"Excellent 5-star hotel!

It was absolutely perfect. The team went above and beyond to make it a special trip. The room was pristine, well appointed, and the room pool cleaned daily. The breakfast had so many good options and from European choices to Greek specialties. We walked to town each day or night, there is a sidewalk most of the time and we didn’t feel unsafe in any way (other reviews said it was dangerous with cars etc). The staff was kind and welcoming. The manager Alexandros is an absolute gem and the lodging is a reflection of his caring and hard work. We’ll be back!","time":"5 months ago"},{"author":"Emily Heitmann","rating":5,"text":"This resort is absolutely magical! The views! The pools! The stellar service! We stayed in the Grand Animos Villa and it was absolutely perfect. The pool is massive and the privacy and unobstructed views meant that we rarely left the backyard. Plus, we had a private cove that offered direct access into the ocean. Fish were everywhere! The team was so helpful in planning catamaran trips as well as local excursions. And the resort food was so delicious. We are already missing that breakfast buffet! We cannot wait to return!","time":"5 months ago"}]'::jsonb,

From the moment we booked in May 2024, we immediately felt comfortable with Jurate and her team and knew we were in good hands—even when planning from abroad! Masia Cabellut lived up to—and surpassed—all of our expectations. The aesthetic, the seamless blend of old and new, the views, and the delicious wines (we loved them all!) cannot be beat.\n\nWe stayed on-site with our family and a few friends, and the accommodations were absolutely breathtaking. Every inch of Masia Cabellut has been renovated with such intention and care. Our wedding day itself is one that our guests will never forget—truly the most stunning venue any of us have ever seen.\n\nBeyond the beauty, every member of the staff was incredibly warm, helpful, and professional. They are truly a top-of-the-line team. We can’t wait to return in the future and will cherish our memories at Masia Cabellut for a lifetime!","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"Jessica Abobo","rating":5,"text":"Absolutely jaw dropping in so many ways!\n\nWe dreamt of a venue that was a vineyard and Masia Cabellut checked off all the boxes. We booked for our destination wedding this past June back in 2023 sight unseen. The property from the vineyard, gardens, to the house - gorgeous and thoughtfully laid out and planned.\n\nWe book three days and had wished we had more time. All of the staff from booking to our stay were so responsive, attentive, and just so helpful.\n\nOur wedding day was a dream. Everything we could have imagined plus more. The setting made it dreamy, romantic, and whisical. Definitely memories we will cherish for a lifetime.","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"Luting Chen","rating":5,"text":"We only happened to visit one wedding venue and decided to go with Masia Cabellut immediately after the visit.

The grounds were perfectly maintained, and the staff (especially Rob) were great about checking in with us the days leading up to the wedding.\n\nWe have received countless compliments from guests regarding the beauty of Masia Cabellut.

But what truly made our experience unforgettable was the people. A huge and heartfelt thank you to Jurate and Roberto in particular who went above and beyond (again and again and again!) Your warmth, professionalism, and care made all the difference. We couldn’t have asked for a more magical setting or better team to help us celebrate our big day.

outside of time. The world stops, and all that remains are the people who matter most in one of the most beautiful places on earth. Our wedding at Can Riera was one of those moments.\n\nCan Riera isn’t just beautiful, it’s breathtaking. Nestled alone in the hills, for three days we existed in our own little universe with nature all around us. It was us, the chickens, Marta and acres and acres of stunning mountains. The house has stood for a thousand years and you can feel every bit of that history. We could literally feel the love in the walls.\n\nAnd then there was Marta, our host.\n\nMarta didn’t just host our wedding, she became family. She held our hands through the chaos of planning, connecting dots we couldn’t see, answering questions we didn’t know to ask. Every detail was touched by her care. The local butcher’s feast at our welcome BBQ. The warm bread that arrived each morning from the village bakery. She made everything so effortless.\n\nOur ceremony was in the forest with a gentle stream as the soundtrack to our vows. The kids were splashing around there all weekend.\n\nWhen we left Can Riera, we cried twice. Once from the overwhelming happiness of what we’d experienced. And again from the sadness of leaving.\n\nMarta and Can Riera are woven into our story forever. They live in our hearts, in our memories, in the very fabric of our marriage.\n\nThank you, Marta. Thank you, Can Riera. You gave us a weekend that was beyond our wildest dreams.","time":"a month ago"},{"author":"Alice Bragg","rating":5,"text":"Had the pleasure of staying here for 3 nights over the weekend of my wedding. The location is beautiful and the house is also magical. The real standout here however is Marta, who runs the venue. She is incredibly helpful and friendly and really helped alleviate a lot of stress and anxiety over the wedding itself and the whole weekend. She was accommodating and communicative and we were really really happy with her! We did have a few issues, namely with the actual house itself which is old, the electrics were patchy with some lights not working in darker areas of the house and no hot water on our final night and morning. There are dogs on site which if you like dogs is a nice treat! However one of these dogs is left chained outside overnight and on our final night she barked throughout the entire night, some guests were unaffected but others did have a sleepless night because of it, there was someone on site overnight so we are not sure why nothing was done but other than this the experience was almost perfect!","time":"7 months ago"},{"author":"Rosalind Warren","rating":5,"text":"Thank you so much to Marta and Pau for the most incredible wedding weekend that exceeded our expectations!\nCan Riera de la Pineda is a little piece of heaven on earth - if you are looking for a wedding venue that is full of love, beauty, and comes with everything you need for a wedding, this is the place for you.\n\nWe booked Can Riera for all our wedding activities and had many of our friends and family staying there with us, which was so special to us as Expats. We organized a rehearsal dinner on Friday, our wedding on Saturday, and an Asado on Sunday - all at Can Riera, and we couldn''t be happier with our choice.\nCan Riera is gorgeous - it is so well maintained, and is a huge property that you can customize to suit your needs. From our ceremony in the forest, our appertivo in the orchard, dinner in the field, and then party by the pool - the huge space lets you have a great flow to your day and keep your guests exploring new areas.\n\nThe property itself is beautiful but what may be even better is Marta and Pau. During the wedding planning process Marta was wonderful to work with - quick to respond, helpful, and I always felt I was in safe hands. She gave great recommendations and helped us immensely. During the wedding weekend Pau was so wonderful with us - he was helping every day to make sure that things went smoothly, and was so supportive and nice to us. We genuinely felt like he was one of our guests because of how nice he was. He let us feel like we were at home and use the space as we needed - he was even supportive of us jumping in the pool at the end of the wedding and greeted us with big towels and a smile!\n\nThank you to Marta, Pau, and everyone at Can Riera.

simple wine tasting: it''s a journey to the heart of winemaking tradition and family passion. This winery, located in a magical setting, combines history, flavor, and hospitality like few others.\n\nWith more than six generations dedicated to the art of wine, Torre del Veguer is a testament to perseverance and love for the land. We were fortunate enough to have the owner himself, Joaquín, guide us on the tour. His passion and knowledge are palpable, as he enthusiastically and meticulously explained every corner of the winery and each stage of the process. Connecting with his family history, passed down from generation to generation, makes everything feel even more special.\n\nThe wines they produce are simply sublime: from the freshest to the most complex, each one has a unique personality that reflects the soul of this winery. The food pairings they offer are a true gift for the palate, with a perfectly curated combination to highlight each flavor and aroma.\n\nBesides the wines, Torre del Veguer itself has a special charm. Its architecture, surrounded by idyllic landscapes, invites you to pause and savor the moment. This place is not only ideal for wine lovers, but also for those seeking an experience that combines culture, gastronomy, and warm hospitality.\n\nIn short, a visit to Torre del Veguer is an unforgettable experience, where tradition and excellence go hand in hand.

Perched on the cliffs between Valldemossa and Deià, it combines history, elegance, and one of the most iconic views on the island. The famous white temple overlooking the sea has become a landmark for Mallorca weddings – and it’s even more magical in real life.\n\nMany couples choose Son Marroig because of its unforgettable sunsets. A ceremony in the garden, with the ocean stretching endlessly behind, feels both romantic and cinematic. From a photographer’s perspective, the light here is extraordinary – soft, golden, and perfectly balanced by the dramatic backdrop of mountains and sea. Every moment becomes a picture you’ll want to frame.\n\nThe venue has space for larger guest lists while still feeling intimate, and it’s flexible enough to host both outdoor and indoor celebrations. Most couples bring in their own catering, rentals, and décor, which makes the event fully customizable with the help of a wedding planner. This gives you the chance to create a wedding weekend that’s entirely your own while anchored in such a historic, timeless setting.\n\nIf you’re dreaming of a destination wedding in Mallorca that feels luxurious, romantic, and truly unforgettable, Son Marroig is one of the best choices you can make.","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"Monica Kennedy","rating":5,"text":"We came across it on accident. We thought it was another close restaurant. We were leaving the view point and decided to go take a look. We paid for the museum and the views were breathtaking. I’ve seen it in a movie and I recognize it right away and I just wanted to stay at the viewpoint forever. We came mid day so there was not a lot of people since it was peak summer season. It is just magical to be at the white gazebo over looking the ocean.~","time":"6 months ago"},{"author":"Katja & Walter Wenegger","rating":5,"text":"We had the honor of capturing a wedding at Son Marroig this past May, and it''s truly one of the most breathtaking wedding venues we''ve ever worked at. The ceremony took place overlooking the sea, with the iconic marble pavilion glowing in the soft light - an absolute dream for any couple (and for photographers and filmmakers too!).\n\nThe atmosphere is so peaceful and romantic, with panoramic views of the cliffs and ocean that create a feeling of total escape. The team managing the venue was organized and helpful, and everything ran smoothly throughout the day.\n\nAs a photo and video team, we especially appreciated the natural beauty of the location - just the stunning Mallorcan coastline and timeless architecture. It''s the kind of place that makes a wedding day feel like a scene from a movie.\n\nIf you''re dreaming of a magical Mediterranean setting for your wedding, Son Marroig is something truly special!","time":"6 months ago"},{"author":"Ann G","rating":5,"text":"This place is just a divine. After being here, you will have no doubt why a member of the monarch family, the Habsburgs, chose this scenic spot for his house. You will be drawn by the nature.\n\nIt''s an informative, compact house-museum with accompanying explanations, real photos, etc. Decorated with freshly flowers...and I would say in such a heat it was a nice touch.\n\nKeep in mind that Luis Salvador wasn''t a man of luxury like SiSi (so don''t expect to see a Hofburg or Belvedere); he was a scientist, explorer, mariner, etc. He simply bought an old, ruined mansion and restored it. It''s simple inside, but impressive outside with terraces and a chapel, and the views just breathtaking.\n\nAll the  belongings and furniture are well preserved and cared.\n\nAn ancient sundial is on the wall of the building, dating from that time. Care to find? :)\n\nA beautiful, small, and well-maintained garden.\n\nInteresting fact: one of the houses that Luis Salvador bought for his \"amante\" in this area now belongs to and is run by Michael Douglas.\n\nAdmission\n1) Fair ticket prices. Adults 4 euros.\n2) Children under 12 (if I am not mistaken) get free admission.\n\nThe opening hours are very limited but accurately reflected by the owners on Google Maps.\n\nIt''s far from civilization and almost impossible to reach by bus. Only cars, bikes, or organized excursions. Parking is available even in summer very nearby.","time":"5 months ago"},{"author":"Nori","rating":5,"text":"Son Marroig is simply magical. I attended a classical concert here and was absolutely enchanted by the atmosphere. The breathtaking view over the sea, the historic architecture, and the overall energy of the place make it truly unique.

From when I booked it a year ago up until we departed, the attention to detail was near perfect. Every aspect of your stay is done so well I was actually waiting for something to go wrong and it never did. Concierge crafted the perfect itinerary for us and made adjustments onsite as needed. There’s also such a low amount of hotel guests that it feels like it’s your own place. The daily breakfast, sea club, and general service from all the hotel employees was truly unreal. The best honeymoon location we could’ve asked for! Thank you Cap Rocat team!!","time":"2 months ago"},{"author":"hannah bates","rating":1,"text":"FOOD POISONING WITH HOSTILE RESPONSE\nI am writing to warn others about a recent (September 2025) visit.The service and hospitality were extremely disappointing and ultimately became hostile as the hotel became concerned about its risk exposure to a health incident for which I believe (but cannot confirm) it was responsible. For context and disclosure on the opinion contained in this review, I work in hospitality and have high expectations, and at the time of my stay at Cap Rocat I was 16 weeks pregnant and traveling alone. I feel obligated to warn all future guests who are considering this property about my experience.\nI acknowledge that it is difficult to identify the precise origin of food poisoning. In this case however, I am extremely confident my food poisoning came from food at Cap Rocat. After arriving and exploring the property in the afternoon, I ordered tagliatelle with shrimp to my room for an early dinner. Approximately four hours after my dinner, I began to experience nausea and within an hour of that vomiting began. Extreme symptoms continued for almost 10 hours after the initial onset. For the duration of my symptoms, I also requested sports drinks, water and ice, which the hotel promptly provided. Not being a health professional, and without access to my OBGYN in the United States to alleviate concerns or guide me through how I could get relief, I was extremely concerned about the health of my baby and to a lesser extent my own health.\nThe doctor who ultimately arrived had excellent bedside manner. Her exam confirmed an elevated heart rate, but she was not able to take my temperature because she had failed to bring a thermometer, explaining the hotel had not notified her about my complaints of a suspected fever. Tests for two types of flu and covid tests all returned negative. Upon finishing the exam, she informed me that after reviewing all of my symptoms she believed I was experiencing food poisoning but without a stool sample it would be impossible to be sure. She gave me anti-nausea medicine and a pregnancy safe fever reducer. She left, and symptoms began to go away. I was not provided a copy of her report.The first indication that the Hotel was concerned about their exposure to my illness came from my travel agent (and friend) who took the initiative to call the hotel when my symptoms were extreme and a doctor was not expected to arrive for many hours. He reported back to me that the hotel was denying all responsibility for my illness. This position continued through checkout, where the hotel maintained that the doctors report indicated that my symptoms were NOT the result of food poisoning and that *if it was food poisoning* it could not have come from the hotel’s kitchens because no other guests who were consuming the hotel’s food had reported issues. Furthermore, the medical report cited by the hotel has still not been provided to me despite repeated requests to the medical group contracted by the hotel. I was hopeful that Cap Rocat would offer *some* gesture to acknowledge my less than pleasant experience that I believe resulted from a lapse in their food safety protocols. This expectation was misplaced. Ultimately the hotel staff treated me with contempt, telling me at checkout that I never had a fever nor food poisoning according to the report, despite what the doctor told me directly, face to face, and the staff refused to take any responsibility for what was quite clearly food poisoning and offered no refund or discount, and no gesture to make up for an unpleasant stay, for which I am highly confident they are to blame.","time":"2 months ago"},{"author":"AGNES SEOW YEAN","rating":1,"text":"No children allow.

absolutely unforgettable! From the moment we arrived early, the team made us feel so welcome, we were invited to enjoy the facilities, even playing a bit of tennis and relaxing by the pool, where we were instantly served refreshing vitamin C spritz and water. Our room was ready by a couple hours early, and the generous upgrade with postcard-perfect views was such a treat!\n\nLunch at Tramuntana Grill and dinner at Restaurante Miró were both top-notch. We loved the welcome wine, nightly treats, and the delicious breakfast with warm, attentive service. The spa was amazing — so peaceful and rejuvenating — and the olive oil class was a fun, educational highlight (we’re still dreaming about the Valrhona chocolate with olive oil and sea salt!).\n\nEvery detail, from start to finish (including the kind gentleman who gave us water for the drive home) reflected genuine care and thoughtfulness. We can’t wait to return to this beautiful sanctuary in Deia!","time":"2 months ago"},{"author":"John Wakefield","rating":5,"text":"Simply magnificent.\nVisited to enjoy afternoon tea on the terrace.\nThis hotel is magical - breathtaking views of the mountains, impeccable service, wonderful gardens, it simply oozes class and elegance.\nIt’s as if you enter a different world.\nWe did stay for 2 nights a few year ago to celebrate my birthday and have visited several times for afternoon tea- it’s one of  best hotels we have been to.","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"Levi Elekes","rating":4,"text":"It was a pleasant experience. The management team was probably the most attentive team we’ve seen so far, making sure everything was okay. The fact that they provided water throughout the property to avoid using plastic was an amazing plus. The cleaning team did their job well, though sometimes they left bottles outside, which could fall and break.\n\nThe scenery is probably the most beautiful we’ve ever seen. We received daily gifts, which was really nice, along with fresh fruit and flowers every day.\n\nHowever, the rooms and services didn’t quite match the price we paid. The restaurant we tried (Miro) was one of the weakest we’ve been to — there are far better options in Deia, so we ended up eating out most of the time.\n\nThe sunset cruise is a must and a really great addition. Overall, the experience was very nice, but we don’t feel it justified the price compared to other places we’ve stayed at for a similar cost.","time":"5 months ago"},{"author":"sydney allen","rating":5,"text":"We just left from our stay at the La Residencia and it was nothing short of perfection. My husband and I just spent the beginning of our honeymoon with them and not only is this property absolutely stunning, the service and attention to detail is unmatched. From start to finish their staff is unbelievably kind, professional, and genuine and truly made our honeymoon better than we could have imagined. Not to mention the food across all the restaurants is fantastic. El Olivo was amazing and such a unique experience but our favorite meal was at Miro. I couldn’t recommend this place more!! Worth every penny!","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"Antoine Eliot","rating":5,"text":"While visiting Deià with my partner, we were eager to experience La Residencia, A Belmond Hotel.\nWe also stopped by the bar, where the experience was truly exceptional thanks to the manager, Jorge. We started inside before he kindly found us a beautiful table on the terrace — the perfect setting.\nA special mention for the Old Fashioned, without question the best I’ve ever had in my life.","time":"2 months ago"}]'::jsonb,

The gardens are truly stunning, and the service throughout our stay was warm and attentive.\n\nOur room interiors looked a bit dated, but they were still very well maintained-spacious, clean, and comfortable. The bedding was wonderful!  Breakfast was a real highlight for me, and we also loved our poolside afternoons and relaxed dinners on-site.\n\nLovely place and would recommend!","time":"6 months ago"},{"author":"Rainer-Christian Koppitz","rating":5,"text":"Beautiful, luxury hide-away in a very quiet, green valley in the Tramuntana mountains.

But the service is atrocious. In no means is this a five star hotel. If it was four stars and less expensive it would’ve made sense. However it was not. Upon checking in they were unprepared and it was bad service from the start. They offered us free breakfast since our room wasn’t ready, and then retracted the offer once we were eating, making us pay. They didn’t notify us when the room was ready as promised, so we waited at the pool in the rain for two extra hours. Upon checking in we wanted to shower and nap. However the shower was broken, spewing water all over the entire bathroom. And the bed sheets were stained with what looked like blood. They came to fix that all but no apologies. There was no valet ready to attend to your car, despite being told you can only valet (we often had to walk inside to hand them the keys, and sometimes no one was even there). There’s a small staff and they’re rarely around. No water in the room with daily cleaning service, no turn down service. If you are expecting five star service at this “five star” hotel, definitely go elsewhere, as you won’t find it here. If you want to overpay for a pretty castle with bad service, you’ve found the place.

The butler service was extremely poor and I would not recommend it at all. Breakfast was acceptable, but the service was very slow.\n\nOne of the most concerning issues we noticed was clear discrimination against Arabs, from the breakfast area to the restaurants. Staff seemed to treat non-Arab guests much better, which was very unpleasant.\n\nThe garden-view rooms were uncomfortable, with many flying insects due to the garden area.

we honestly couldn’t have dreamed of a more magical, breathtaking venue. From the moment we arrived, we were blown away by the natural beauty of the location – nestled in the stunning Mallorcan countryside, with incredible views, lush gardens, and that perfect rustic elegance that’s impossible to replicate.\n\nBut what truly made the experience unforgettable was the amazing team behind the scenes. Lucia and Eli, the venue-based planners, are absolute superstars. From the very first email to the last dance of the night, they were supportive, responsive, and incredibly talented. Their attention to detail, creative ideas, and calm professionalism meant we were able to relax and fully enjoy every moment. Nothing was ever too much trouble, and they made sure everything ran seamlessly on the day.\n\nOur guests are still talking about how stunning the venue was and how well-organised everything felt – and that’s entirely thanks to Lucia and Eli.\n\nIf you’re considering getting married in Mallorca, Finca Son Berga is everything you could want and more. We feel so lucky to have celebrated our day there and will treasure the memories forever.

There are no words to describe this incredible venue!\n\nFrom the moment we visited Son Berga for the first time, we knew this venue was the one for us! The feeling we got when we stepped out of our hire car and were greeted by the amazing Eli, we just had that magical feeling!\n\nEli & Lucia, who work here, are two ladies who go above and beyond to make sure everything goes perfect for their couples. They helped us with the planning, booking the best suppliers on the island and were there to run our special day where they had everything timed to perfection and their calm and kind aura was a joy to be around.\n\nWe had several video calls and visited the venue in person a couple of times - the ladies always had everything under control and made everything stress free. The technical visit day was a dream - where we got to visit the showroom and choose all of our decor and finer details. The finca itself - interiors and exteriors are absolutely immaculate and Eli takes so much pride in her “baby.” Every bit of stone work is perfect and all flowers were in full bloom - it was absolutely stunning. The backdrop for the ceremony/aisle walk is breathtaking and looks like something from a movie.\n\nI don’t think we will ever come down from cloud 9 after getting married at the beautiful Finca Son Berga and even our guests are still talking about the venue and the food by Vicky Pulgarin - I will leave a seperate review on this because - WOW!!\n\nWe are looking at photos and in disbelief that this day was ours.

is a good option if you want to stay away of the crowded city Center. Pool is amazing, but pool service lacks quality. They close the pool at 7pm during summer which is a bummer if you want to enjoy the hotel after a day at the beach. The main reason we decided to stay there was because of the pool, but we were always late for the pool schedule.\n\nRestaurants are ok and breakfast is good. It’s a historical hotel with beautiful decor and luxurious vibes. Great price point if you want some luxury in Mallorca but do not have the budget to stay closer to the beach.\n\nA part from the pool staff, overall service is very attentive and kind. They went above and beyond to help us figure out how to charge the rental car.\n\nRecommend drinks by bar before or after dinner.","time":"2 months ago"},{"author":"Sergio Sovero","rating":1,"text":"Absolutely unacceptable experience — stay away.\n\nTo make the story short, two cockroaches were found in the bathroom during my stay. I immediately called the front desk expecting urgency or at least some level of concern. Instead, a staff member casually came to the room, killed one of the cockroaches, couldn’t find the other one, and just left as if this was completely normal. No apology, no shock, nothing.\n\nI asked to be moved to a different room — a very reasonable request — and was told it was “not possible,” even though the hotel was clearly not sold out. I ended up barely sleeping all night knowing there was still a cockroach loose somewhere in the room. Completely unacceptable, unsanitary, and unprofessional.\n\nI’m attaching videos and photos because this experience speaks for itself. This property needs serious attention to cleanliness and customer service. I will not be returning and cannot recommend it to anyone.\n\nSo far, I emailed the GM a week ago and no reply! They simply don’t care. Good luck staying in this “luxury collection” property.\n\nRegards,\nA Marriot Platinum Elite Member","time":"a month ago"},{"author":"David McMurtrie","rating":5,"text":"Beautiful hotel situated in the hills above Palma and with great views over the city.

could not recommend it enough for any couples that are looking for a venue on the Island.\n\nThe setting is beautiful, the team are incredible and the support that you get from the Leah and Vikki in the run up to the day gave us the peace of mind we needed when planning a destination wedding. All of this combined made our wedding day one to remember.\n\nI do believe one of the main selling points of this venue (beyond the gorgeous views) is the team on hand. They were exceptional and we have had many comments from our guests which demonstrates the lasting impression they have had. Each team member was attentive, personable and generally invested in ensuring that everyone was having the best day possible. If you are looking for somewhere where children can be accommodated for, we would definitely recommend the Kids Corner option that is available through the venue which was such a great touch for our younger guests and their parents!\n\nWe also could not fault the food & drinks on offer either and again is still something our guests are raving about a month on!\n\nif you are looking for a venue that captures the best of Ibiza - modern, stylish and fun - this is one to have a look at!\n\nThank you for hosting us and for a memorable wedding weekend!","time":"2 months ago"},{"author":"Zoe Moore-Williams","rating":5,"text":"Woah!

They honestly couldn’t do enough for us, they were simply brilliant! It’s been 3 weeks since our big day and our guests are still talking about the amazing food and drinks Elixir served up. I cannot thank you guys enough for making our day so magical, my only wish is that we could do it all over again! It was 10/10 on every level!

We got married on 13.07.23 and it was unforgettable!!\n\nClear blue skies, a stunning colourful sunset, beautiful views of magnetic Es Vedra, a picture perfect bay to look upon, excitement in the air…. It was just UNREAL!!\n\nThe moment you walk through the doors it takes your breath away!!! The first time we went to Elixir was the day before the wedding and I burst into tears of pure joy. It was literally everything we had hoped for and much more.\n\nThe backdrop is second to none but the service that Elixir provide is seamless and perfect. The decor is taken care of with precision, we had beautiful roses and a gorgeous table design. We had a fully vegetarian meal, our guests still rave about the delicious and plentiful tapas boards, the gorgeous starters and the mouth watering desserts. The drinks package kept on giving and we were all spoilt with endless cold drinks to cool us down in the heatwave that was our wedding day!\n\nVickki and the team went out of their way to make our dreams come to life. We wanted a seating  plan with a bespoke design - cocktail glasses presented in a beautiful display, each with guest name and table name attached (see photo) - it turned out perfect! It was so touching that she came to greet us at the meal and had personally seen us at the ceremony, we could feel how much she cares about her guests!\n\nMauricio met us the day before and was so calming and reassuring. What a beautiful soul! Every single one of our many requests was met with a smile and a can- do attitude. Nothing was too much trouble to achieve and we felt completely supported in making the day exactly how we had envisaged. He was seamless in his efforts to organise our ceremony and our guests and keep the events of the day running smoothly.\n\nOne highlight of the day was taking a walk along Cala Codolar beach as newly weds, a glass of ice cold champagne in hand and the feint buzz of our guests enjoying themselves on the Elixir terrace above. The sun was setting over the breathtaking horizon and our hearts were filled with LOVE.\n\nWhat we would give to do it all again!! Thank you so much Elixir for making our special day truly amazing xxx","time":"11 months ago"},{"author":"Youri Claessens Photography","rating":5,"text":"I had the pleasure of photographing a lot of weddings at this stunning venue and I have to say, I can highly recommend this venue. The location was simply breathtaking, with panoramic views of the sparkling sea and the rugged Ibiza coastline. The venue itself was beautifully designed, with elegant, modern decor that perfectly complemented the natural surroundings.\n\nThe staff were incredibly helpful and attentive, making sure that everything ran smoothly throughout the entire event. From the catering to the entertainment, every aspect of the wedding was top-notch and flawlessly executed.\n\nThank you so much to the amazing team of Elixir who makes my work as a wedding photographer also easier.

Cocktails were elevated and on point too, But the special highlight? The flamenco performance – passionate, soulful, and done with such grace and style.

Finish\n\nI reserved the private dining table at Restaurante Amente because I wanted to enjoy the full experience about everything this place has to offer and wow, was I right. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left..\n\nThe setting is absolutely stunning, the kind of place where you instantly feel relaxed and happy the moment you walk in. The atmosphere, the view, the soft warmth of the evening, the music… everything came together beautifully.\n\nThe location alone is absolutely breathtaking, the kind of place that instantly gives you goosebumps. The service was incredible, not just attentive, but genuinely heartfelt. We were lucky to have Yordi as our private butler, and what a beautiful soul he is. He made us feel completely at ease, cared for us in every detail, and added so much warmth to the evening.\n\nThe menu, created especially for us with the freshest products of the day, was a sensational journey. Every dish was a surprise, every bite full of flavor, and the wine pairings were simply perfect, the kind that make you close your eyes for a moment just to enjoy it fully.\n\nHonestly, this was nothing short of a magical night in August 2025. One word: unforgettable. We will 100% be coming back. Without exaggeration, this is one of the best restaurants we have ever visited.. If not the single best dining experience of our lives.","time":"a month ago"},{"author":"Jaskiran Kaur","rating":4,"text":"The most stunning dinner view I have ever seen. Breathtaking.\nBut do reserve the place well in advance.\nIt gets prettier when it starts to get dark and lights come out.\nFor a place that pretty, the food is surprisingly good as well.\nWe ordered beetroot starter which had refreshing and fresh flavours.\nFor mains we ordered the Risotto and Spaghetti. The Risotto was exceptional as it had a strong flavour of truffle.\nWhile the vegan options are limited but the food was good.\n\nWhile the desserts looked really appetising, we didn’t have space for alot so we went for an affogato. This was my first time ever and we loved the taste.\n\nWhile the place is on the expensive side, but it’s truly worth every penny you spend here.","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"Vittoria Brondin","rating":4,"text":"This beachfront restaurant is truly a hidden gem in Ibiza, offering a charming setting and a memorable dining experience. While the adjacent beach area could benefit from better maintenance and cleanliness, the restaurant itself is well worth a visit for lunch or dinner.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious,flavorful, well-prepared, and beautifully presented. However, the portions were on the smaller side, especially considering the higher price point. Typically, Spanish cuisine is known for its generous servings, so this was a bit unexpected.\n\nBe prepared for high pricing, but keep in mind that you''re paying for the overall experience, not just the meal. The ambiance, location, and attentive service contribute to the value.\n\nA special mention goes to Stefania, our waitress, who was incredibly friendly and helpful.\n\nWhile the restaurant itself is lovely, it''s not ideal if you''re looking for a budget-friendly beach day. The sunbeds and umbrellas are quite expensive, and unfortunately, the sea in this area wasn''t very clean during our visit. I would strongly recommend more attention to maintaining the beach area to fully complement the otherwise excellent restaurant experience.","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"Carl Birkenshaw","rating":5,"text":"We had a fantastic dining experience here – the service was superb, and Berta was the perfect host, attentive and warm, making sure nothing was too much trouble.\n\nThe food was excellent from start to finish. I started with the clams, which were fresh, full of flavour, and perfectly cooked in a delicate broth. Clare had the croquettes – crisp on the outside and deliciously soft inside – a real highlight. For mains, Clare enjoyed the black squid ink risotto with scallops, which was rich, creamy, and beautifully presented, while I had the veal chop with homemade fries, cooked to perfection and full of flavour.\n\nWe finished with coffee, which rounded off what was a wonderful meal. The quality of the ingredients, the presentation, and the relaxed yet professional service made the whole experience memorable.\n\nHighly recommended","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"Olivier Populaire","rating":5,"text":"One of Ibiza’s finest restaurants.

My stay there was for a wedding playing saxophone and it really was wonderful.","time":"5 months ago"},{"author":"April Clarke","rating":5,"text":"We just hosted the most incredible wedding at this uniquely rustic hotel on the beautiful island of Ibiza.\n\nSanti, Ana, Rachel & team could not do enough for not only us as the couple but all guests staying with us. All guests complimented the ease of the place and instantly felt at home, others had recommended it to family and friends whilst still at the hotel.\n\nRachel’s attention to detail and drive to make the bride feel at ease throughout the lead up and planning is superb. I was so relaxed I was sure I’d missed something but she keeps you honest and gives you a nudge on securing suppliers (which are in a league of their own).\n\nMy words can’t do justice to how it made myself and guests feel having somewhere so organised yet relaxed to make the whole weekend enjoyable.\n\nIf you are debating whether to choose this as your wedding venue I will promise you, you  won’t be disappointed.\n\nThanks so much for the most memorable time.\n\nWe hope to come back and see you soon.","time":"a year ago"},{"author":"Laura Andrews","rating":5,"text":"Wow, where do we start.\nWe were lucky enough to be shown this venue by my mother in law when searching for somewhere in Ibiza to hold our wedding. Can Gall is a little hidden gem, only to be found by those lucky enough. As all the other reviews say Santi, Ana and Rachel, along with Augustine and the team are incredible and quite honestly make you feel like you are royalty whilst you are there.\nWe originally visited in Aug last year to view for the first time along with some other venues and as soon as the gates opened to reveal Can Gall we both knew this was the one. Rachel has been outstanding throughout the last 12 months helping us to plan the wedding of our dreams. Nothing is too much for her and she guides you through what is required with ease. I could go into reams of detail about how fab she is but there isn’t room on here!\nThe same for Santi and Ana, they really do make you and all of our guests feel so special from the second you arrive. Nothing is too much and they work around the clock to do what they can for you. From the seamless check in, the stunning meal the eve before the wedding to the pool party the day after. We honestly can’t thank them enough and are desperate to return and visit again soon.\nThere really isn’t enough room here for me to tell you how fantastic they are but if you are considering booking and have any questions I’d be more than happy for you to message me.\n\nIf you find this venue, you really are one of the lucky ones.\n\nThank you to Santi, Ana, Rachel and team for everything. Last weekend really was the wedding of dreams for us.\nLaura & Ben","time":"a year ago"},{"author":"Ian Gordon","rating":5,"text":"Just enjoyed the most amazing wedding for my daughter. She found the venue (and obviously her new husband and I agreed!) but could not find fault. The setting is beautiful and authentic old charm. Santi is an amazing host -lovely man where nothing is too much trouble - and a great chef. A 4 night event for us - meal on the Thursday was excellent chicken thighs , chill by the pool Friday , wedding Saturday ( sun came out bang on time after torrential rain!) so able to be outdoors. Is ideal covered area with open sides if the worst happens!  Nothing was too much trouble. The drinks packs take a bit of getting used to -have to guess what might consume ( although more was available to buy). We had a lot of soft drinks left including water - alcohol however was a different matter!  Tip. Get guests to restock mini bar from soft drinks package not drunk or you pay for water from the mini bar   There are extra snacks available on non actual wedding day - pizza etc - which was helpful tho cost can add up.\nBreakfast served from 9am ( civilised !). Outside catering used for actual wedding.\n\nDo highly recommend. Easy taxi to anywhere on Ibiza. Thanks Santi and team.  Sadly won’t be back!","time":"a year ago"},{"author":"John Hedley","rating":5,"text":"Many reviews have described Can Gall and to be honest they are all true. Santi and Anna, the owners of Gan Gall, are the most honest hardworking hotel proprietors my wife and I have come  across. No fault could be found from the cleanliness of the rooms to the perfect presentation of the exterior facilities.\nNothing is to much trouble for any of the staff as they have only the comfort of the guests in mind. All we had to do was enjoy the piece and quiet of such bountiful surroundings, which there was in abundance.\nThank you for a wonderful stay and sincerely hope to be back soon.","time":"2 years ago"}]'::jsonb,

truly pleasant overnight stay at 7Pines Ibiza. The room was spacious, clean, and tastefully decorated, with all the amenities you would expect from a luxury resort. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and the overall atmosphere of the property made it easy to relax and disconnect.\n\nBreakfast the next morning was excellent. There was a wide selection of high-quality items, both sweet and savory, and everything was beautifully presented. The pancakes stood out! Freshly made, soft, and perfectly balanced in flavor. Service was attentive but discreet, and the setting made the whole experience feel peaceful and refined.\n\nWe would definitely return.","time":"5 months ago"},{"author":"James Freel","rating":5,"text":"The stay overall was fantastic, but for us the highlight by far was the breakfast.\n\nOur breakfast at 7Pines was absolutely fantastic, and a huge part of that was due to Issachar. He provided first-class service from start to finish. He was incredibly personable and attentive, and nothing was too much trouble for him.\nIssachar, a big thank you from your \"amigos from Scotland\" for all your hard work and for making our breakfast experience so special!\n\nAnother big shout out to Enrique at the Cone Club chill out area for the sunset experience. We attended most evenings for food and drinks and again, his service was exceptional.","time":"4 months ago"},{"author":"M.

The staff are all very friendly and welcoming (every single one of them) and I want to give special recognition to Addaya from the pool bar, who took care of us throughout the day and made our experience unforgettable.\n\nThe DJ at the pool created the perfect vibe – it honestly felt like living out my dream day, the kind I had only seen on YouTube videos of Ibiza beach clubs.\n\nLater at the sunset bar (Cone Club), the atmosphere was just as incredible. Roman made our night amazing with his attentive service and warm attitude.\n\nThank you, Addaya, Roman, the Cone Club team, and thank you, 7Pines.\n\nI will definitely come back, and this place has now become one of my go-to favorite locations in Ibiza.","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"Lucia Corral","rating":5,"text":"I celebrated my birthday with a romantic dinner at 7Pines Ibiza and it was truly unforgettable. The location is absolutely dreamy, with a breathtaking view that created the perfect atmosphere from the very beginning.\n\nEvery dish by Chef Bruno was a surprise and each course exceeded our expectations. What made the experience even more special was when Chef Bruno himself came out of the kitchen to introduce himself and personally ask how our dinner was going, a treatment worthy of a true luxury restaurant.\nEasily one of the best dinners we have ever had.\n\nI could not have asked for a better way to celebrate, and I have already decided that from now on, this is where I will celebrate all my birthdays.","time":"5 months ago"},{"author":"Mayara Hiromi","rating":5,"text":"Amazing place!

beach bar and restaurant.\n\nWe arrived in the early hours when they had just opened, so there was plenty of free parking in front of the restaurant itself.\n\nThe beach is very nice, the sunbeds are very comfortable. The price of 160 euros for the two of us included the following things: sunbeds with umbrella, towels, water and sangria. The staff is very friendly, both on the beach and in the restaurant.\n\nWe ate sea bass in the restaurant, which was very tasty, and the view from the restaurant which is on the cliff is amazing.\n\nAlso, a table in the restaurant should be reserved in advance.","time":"5 months ago"},{"author":"Christian Crostelli","rating":5,"text":"Stunning Dining Experience\nDelicious food with breathtaking views from a beautiful terrace.

While I think we had the absolute best views of the dining area, we also were on the only spot with no fans/AC and it was quite hot. We went for my partner’s birthday, which I communicated to the service, so they brought us a beautiful dessert and sang happy birthday for him. When we asked for the bill, I saw that we were being charged for the dessert. I didn’t feel comfortable bringing it up as the meal had been quite pleasant and I didn’t want it to come across the wrong way as restaurants are not obliged to offer free items for celebrations, but would have loved to be able to choose myself from the dessert menu if I had known that beforehand - just an idea! Again, pretty great overall and would come again!","time":"9 months ago"},{"author":"Germanrubchinskiy","rating":2,"text":"Red Thai Curry - the curry was too watery.\n\nThe angus beef burger was ok.

Probably the most relaxing hotel stay we''ve ever had. We had a warm welcome from Cali and felt very at ease on arrival. We opted for the Ibizan Palace room as it was our first wedding anniversary and it was so private, spacious and relaxing. We slept more than we ever have as we were in total bliss - thankfully the daily yoga with Natalie was so great in the morning we had something to set an alarm for! You feel totally at ease here, rooms are cleaned twice a day as if by magic and complimentary water and towels always replenished. Breakfasts were amazing, plenty of space for all guests and great service, especially from Vanessa. Lovely big pool and very comfortable loungers. Food is expensive but very worth the money, very healthy and fresh! The whole place is a haven, no road noise or stress at any time, all staff had a positive attitude and very helpful, I liked how they were attentive but not overbearing. Room service was very easy and quick. First holiday we felt like we''d lost weight, which we don''t know how, could be all the fat held on by stress was released! Thanks Cas Gasi team for a wonderful stay","time":"2 years ago"},{"author":"C Chan","rating":5,"text":"Having previously only stayed in villas on the island, this is as close to that experience as you''re going to get in a hotel.  Although the room decor is dated and the hard fittings like the bathroom are not very luxurious, the room amenities like the linen, toiletries, robes, slippers, coffee machine, kettle, beach bag & towels etc are top quality and the aircon units are modern and quiet.  The best thing about the hotel though is the size of the facilities and common areas vs the number of rooms.  It has all the facilities of a much larger luxury property but only shared by 18 rooms, so there are loads of places to hang out and you never have to worry about not getting a sunbed by the pool or reserving a table for lunch or dinner.  It''s also in a great location- completely peaceful and rural, but only a 20-25 min taxi ride to ibiza town.  Was great to be able to go clubbing easily and then return to such a peaceful environment to recover.","time":"a year ago"},{"author":"danuta freeman","rating":5,"text":"This is an incredible place.

We were welcomed by one of the buggy masters who took our clubs and set us up at the range. After using all practice facilities to warm up (which are amazing), we were loaded up into our buggies and taken to the first tee.\n\nThere is nothing I can fault about the place. Love it! Yes, it’s on the pricey side, but honestly it is worth it. I’ll be back for my third round next year. Enjoy!","time":"4 months ago"},{"author":"Jasper-Hugo Brouwers","rating":2,"text":"I booked Finca Cortesin through American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts, expecting the level of service and room quality that FHR properties normally guarantee. Unfortunately, the one night stay was disappointing and falls closer to 2.5 stars than 5. I hate to give negative reviews, and it’s disappointing to have to do so.\n\nDespite the beautiful grounds and excellent spa treatments, our room was not in proper condition for a €550+ rate: some visible dirt, heavy calcium/limescale buildup in the showerhead, and as a result rain shower with diverse non consistent water flow as a result. We also found ants in the room first thing in the morning, near the coffee machine and in our beds. I immediately informed reception before breakfast. The solution offered was to spray the room—which was impossible due to health issues, I was traveling with my elderly mother. Despite reporting it promptly in the morning, no manager approached us proactively, neither during nor after breakfast, which is simply not 5-star luxury service. These issues combined are not acceptable at this price point or for a hotel presented as one of Europe’s top resorts.\n\nWhat disappointed me most was the tone of the follow-up communication, implying that I had not reported the issue “correctly.” Also the hotel said they checked and did not find any ants, although we saw and felt them… and I made a picture and videos of it (although I did clean the area first with wipes when we did notice the ants). This placed responsibility back on me as the guest, instead of acknowledging the lapse. I did read in older reviews this has happened before at this hotel when guests have issues. At comparable hotels (e.g., Four Seasons), management would proactively handle the situation and offer a meaningful gesture or refund.\n\nThere were also other inconsistencies:\n– being told milk for coffee in the room wasn’t complimentary when it was\n- be aware there are no tea facilities in the room\n- ironing a shirt is not possible, as an iron is not available and only through a laundry service for an additional fee (when I complained about that a steamer to borrow was offered).\n– breakfast service that felt below a true luxury standard, with very mixed service and not attentive.\n\nWhile the spa therapists are great, spa employees were very friendly and property itself are beautiful located and feels in some areas like a museum, the service in general, the service recovery, room quality, and management response were very far below what I expect from an FHR property. A partial refund or discount on room rate would have been appropriate, but none was offered (only if I’d return they would give me”special treatment as a guest”).\n\nOverall: a 2.5-star experience at a 5-star price. I cannot recommend Finca Cortesin, especially to Amex FHR guests. There are nearby luxury properties that deliver far more consistent service—choose those instead. E.g. Nobu in Marbella or La Zambra in Mijas. The hotel suggested I had not reported the issue “correctly,” which made me feel blamed as a guest rather than supported…","time":"a month ago"},{"author":"Cigdem Duysal","rating":4,"text":"This is a private and exclusive property.

From the moment we entered the majestic driveway and saw the stunning golf lawns, we knew our stay would be special—but the hotel exceeded every expectation.\n\nThe staff upgraded us to a beautiful room for our anniversary and made us feel genuinely cherished. Their warmth, hospitality, and attention to detail were flawless. Room service was exceptional, the valet service was absolutely worth it, and every interaction felt personal and thoughtful.\n\nThe spa facilities were a complete indulgence—the hammam, salt bath, and heated pool were such a treat that we barely wanted to leave the hotel for our planned activities. It truly felt like living inside a palace, wrapped in comfort, luxury, and care. The property itself is so stunning that it becomes an experience in its own right.\n\nWe had the most magical two days here. Anantara Villa Padierna Palace sets a standard far above typical European luxury and is easily one of the best hotels to stay at in Europe. A stay here is pure joy, and we left wishing we could’ve stayed much longer.","time":"a month ago"},{"author":"mario ponikvar","rating":5,"text":"A very pleasant stay.  Very helpful personnel.

From the moment we arrived, everything was handled with such care and attention to detail that it made us feel completely at ease. The setting is breathtaking, surrounded by the beauty of the Costa del Sol, and the entire property is designed to offer both comfort and elegance.\n\nMeals were consistently excellent, with a breakfast selection that truly stood out—fresh, diverse, and beautifully presented. The seafood options throughout our stay were especially memorable. The private beach area is a perfect retreat, providing everything you need for a relaxed day by the sea. Evenings were elevated by live music and talented performers, creating a wonderful atmosphere.\n\nWe want to extend our heartfelt thanks to Carlota, who always went above and beyond to ensure everything was arranged flawlessly, making our stay not only perfect but also truly personal. A special mention as well to Razvan, whose professionalism, kindness, and genuine care made us feel incredibly well looked after.\n\nIn short, this hotel exceeded all of our expectations and gave our family a week we will never forget.

unparalleled experience of elegance and comfort.\n\nSpecial thanks to Maria and Jaden at the front desk for their exceptional professionalism and heartfelt hospitality — they made our stay truly unforgettable.\n\nThe breakfast was remarkably generous and beautifully curated, easily one of the best among five-star hotels. The setting was equally elegant, making every morning feel like a serene indulgence.\n\nDinner was slightly on the pricier side, but the flavors were genuinely enjoyable and well-executed.","time":"a month ago"},{"author":"María Agustina","rating":5,"text":"The service is very good — everyone is extremely attentive all the time. However, the room was quite outdated for what you would expect from a hotel of this category. The furniture looks old and very worn, and the décor is rather unattractive.\nThe food offered through room service leaves a lot to be desired, especially considering the prices. A Caesar salad costs almost €40, and there’s really nothing special about it — I’d even dare to say the one from McDonald’s tastes better.\nOn the positive side, the Kids Club is absolutely beautiful and very well equipped. All the girls and boys who work there are truly professional and incredibly kind and loving with the children — they do an excellent job.\nThe surroundings are beautiful and picturesque, and there’s always something going on in the evenings. The staff is VERY friendly, and there are plenty of services available. But honestly, I wouldn’t return, as the value for money just isn’t worth it.","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"amina houssa","rating":1,"text":"Terrible service and security  very disappointing stay\nI stayed at Marbella Club Hotel for 4 days in room 266. During our stay, someone stole €400 from my bag inside the room, and my friend also had $600 and £100 stolen. We immediately reported it, but the staff did absolutely nothing. No apology, no investigation, no support just silence.\n\nThe service overall was terrible. Room service took over 2 hours to deliver food, and when it finally arrived, it was cold and poorly prepared.\n\nFor a hotel with this reputation, I expected much better. But instead, we felt unsafe, disrespected, and completely ignored. I do not recommend this place to anyone. The lack of security and basic service is unacceptable.","time":"5 months ago"},{"author":"Gina Sayed","rating":5,"text":"This feels like a dreamresort and the best we ever visited.

So many facilities like a wellness spa, kidsclub and you can walk straightaway into the beach and clear sea. Even the pool and bar is amazing.

A rhythm. A completely different standard of luxury that you rarely find, even in the most prestigious places.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, it was clear: this isn’t about flashy glamour. It’s understated elegance, deeply rooted in heritage and soul. The entire property is breathtakingly beautiful — perfectly manicured gardens, timeless architecture, and a layout that feels more like a private village than a resort. Every corner has character. Every view is calming.\n\nOur suite was pure perfection — spacious, refined, filled with natural light, and designed with a quiet sense of luxury that speaks for itself. Everything felt intentional, from the linens to the lighting.\n\nBut what truly sets Marbella Club apart is the service. This is not just staff — these are hosts. Warm, intuitive, and effortlessly attentive without ever being intrusive. You don’t even need to ask — they already know. Every interaction felt personal, not rehearsed.\n\nThere’s a serenity to this place that’s hard to describe. Whether you’re having breakfast under the bougainvillea, relaxing by the pool, or walking to the beach club — you feel completely at ease.\n\nThis wasn’t a stay. This was a reset. We left feeling lighter, inspired, and already planning our return.\n\nMarbella Club doesn’t compete with other hotels — it transcends them.","time":"5 months ago"}]'::jsonb,

Nice staff, very friendly. Room depends on the specific location in the resort. We had a very good suite with sea view. Very nice. World class breakfast!! You can even stuff your fresh croissant with various stuffings like apricot marmelade. Great egg preparation station. And much more that you can‘t find in other 5 star hotels!! Beach is fantastic, wonderful chiringuito close by, kilometers beach promenade, far away from any traffic. Just great!!!","time":"a month ago"},{"author":"Tim Bradowski","rating":3,"text":"We stayed at Puente Romano for a week, and overall it is a mixed experience. Some areas truly impressed us, while others fell short for a resort of this calibre.\n\nFirstly, what an amazing resort. You really feel like you are walking through a botanical garden. The grounds are beautifully maintained, and the atmosphere is serene and luxurious. The restaurants are outstanding, and the breakfast selection can easily satisfy even the pickiest eaters. The facilities, including the pools, tennis club, and beach, were all excellent, and we genuinely enjoyed spending time around the property.\n\nHowever, the room experience was disappointing. For a hotel of this standard, I expected more attention to detail. The handheld shower head is mounted far too low, which means you are forced to use the rainfall shower instead. Unfortunately, the water temperature between the two was very different, with the handheld being much hotter, which was uncomfortable when switching. The bathtub showed visible signs of wear and even some mould, so we decided not to use it. The towel rail setup is also poorly thought out, as there are only two hooks, both used for bathrobes, leaving nowhere to hang towels. The steamer and board were a nice touch, but there was nowhere practical to set them up. The coffee cups in the room were very pretty, but they did not fit the coffee machine, which made it almost impossible to use without spilling.\n\nOne night, we had a terrible experience when our room key stopped working at around 1 a.m. I had to walk to reception, after a few drinks, to reactivate the card, but when I returned, it still did not work. After calling the hotel and being transferred twice, concierge eventually sent someone with a new card about 25 minutes later. The receptionist’s handling of the situation was shockingly poor.\n\nAnother issue was the language barrier. For a five-star resort that hosts international guests, I expected staff to have a reasonable level of English. On multiple occasions, I had to repeat myself several times for simple requests such as asking for a buggy at checkout. A mix-up at the tennis club was particularly frustrating, as I booked two padel courts but was told I had booked a tennis lesson instead.\n\nLastly, service at Six Senses breakfast one morning was chaotic. After being seated, we asked three different staff members for coffee. It took around 15 minutes before it finally arrived, twice. I understand that breakfast can get busy, but either more staff or better coordination would make a big difference.\n\nOverall, Puente Romano is a stunning resort with world-class facilities and dining, but the service inconsistency and room maintenance issues really let it down. With a few improvements in staff training and attention to detail, it could truly live up to its five-star reputation.","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"S H","rating":1,"text":"I stayed at Puente Romano with high expectations but felt the experience didn’t match the very high prices. The beach is small and poorly maintained with limited, dated sunbeds. On several occasions there was no space at either the pools or the beach for guests, which is disappointing at a hotel of this level. The pools themselves are small and dated, with too few staff to assist, and breakfast often meant long waits with food quality that could be improved. Our “junior suite” felt tired, with uncomfortable furniture and no AC in the bathroom. Much of the hotel overall has a slightly claustrophobic and dated feel, with some rooms along a public road and the better stretch of beach requiring an extra fee. The property also feels extremely over-commercialised, with branding everywhere to the point where people even try to sell you perfume as you walk through the hotel grounds. The restaurants in the main square of the hotel demand minimum spends of €100–200 per person, even for hotel guests, which feels unreasonable. While the property is marketed at the level of Four Seasons or Belmond, the reality felt closer to a four-star standard. The staff were consistently kind and helpful, and the gym is excellent and modern, which were the highlights of the stay. However, overall I wouldn’t consider ever coming back to this hotel.","time":"4 months ago"},{"author":"HELLO BEAUTY","rating":5,"text":"✨ A top-notch experience in Marbella!

Momma is the inspiration for the recipes but it is Anthony, the co-owner, son and perfect host who makes the entire experience so memorable.

If you don''t, the glass gazebo where you''ll be celebrating your wedding will burn down in less than a month. The event company (Visi, Verónica) gives you very good words and tells you not to worry, that they''ll do everything possible to make everything perfect. What they give you is a plastic tent, which is what you absolutely didn''t want, which is why you ordered the glass gazebo. The thing is, THERE WAS NO CONSIDERATION ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY AND NO PRICE ADJUSTMENT (apparently, a tent that looked like a booth at the April Fair costs the same as the gazebo). On top of that, we were the first to use the tent, so it didn''t have any decorations of any kind, just four bare flower pots.\nI have to say that both the cocktail party and the menu were very good, as was the terrace, the gardens, and the nightclub, but the food was horrible and, on top of that, at an unbelievable price. They told us that to alleviate what had happened, they would offer some small gifts to the bride and groom, and we''re still waiting for them. The only gesture was to politely say \"hello and goodbye\" to everyone, and of course, immediately charge over 1,000 euros for an extra hour of open bar and disco at the end. (At my daughter''s wedding elsewhere, they gave us that gift; that would have been a small gift they could have offered us, but they charged us every cent.)\nIn short, the treatment we received from Visi and Verónica was extremely unprofessional and unpleasant, lying the entire time and passing the buck. The only ones who have paid for this misfortune were the bride and groom that day and the future bride and groom who get married there. The company will collect their insurance and will have no problem rebuilding the gazebo in the future, but everything bad about the fire affects the bride and groom. They wash their hands of it perfectly.","time":"3 months ago"},{"author":"Felipe Santorio Ramos","rating":1,"text":"CONTINUED COMPLAINT REGARDING THE PLASTIC TENT AT THE WEDDING:\n\nI don''t know where you got the idea that someone in our family told you in writing that we were absolutely delighted with everything that happened, because it''s simply not true. We tried, for the sake of the bride and groom, to make sure everything went smoothly and that people didn''t notice, or didn''t want to notice, that the tent where the reception was held was awful. And the truth is, our friends and family made it a wonderful day, thanks to everyone. But, of course, we can''t forget that we were treated terribly when it came to providing us with a better-equipped and more attractive venue for the day. Therefore, we don''t think it''s fair that only the bride and groom should bear the brunt of the problem and the misfortune that occurred, as it has all had repercussions for them. You will, of course, collect your insurance, and you should have charged us for the tent venue at the price for a plastic tent, not at the price for a glass pavilion, because there''s no comparison between the two. And we''re still waiting for the compensation they were supposed to offer the couple, which never materialized. Furthermore, we''re not creating any insecurity for future couples getting married there; we''re simply telling the truth about what happened to us and how they took advantage of the excitement and, above all, the fear of a young couple terrified by what had transpired, nothing more and nothing less. And to make matters worse, when we went to collect the leftover wedding items, they treated the people who came very badly and rudely, which was highly unprofessional of them.","time":"2 months ago"},{"author":"Marcos Ramirez","rating":5,"text":"A beautiful venue for events, the staff are very attentive and provide personalized service, and the scenery is stunning.

five days at the Melia Palacio de los Duques .....it was possibly one of the best holidays we have experienced.  The hotel was in a fantastic location, on a quiet street simply a block away from the Gran Via shopping area.  We didn''t come to shop....we simply wanted a place where we had some quiet time away from the hustle and bustle of the crowds.  When we arrived, we were greeted with the greatest of respect and gratitude.  We were given a lovely tour of our room and welcomed to the Melia hotel.  The room was quiet and serene, absolutely beautiful and tastefully decorated.  We had a beautiful bath tub in the room surrounded by glass, but it still afforded privacy if one needed that.\nWe experienced a wonderful buffet breakfast each morning, and the selection was abundant.  Over the holiday season the hotel had incredible entertainment of a guitar singer for breakfast and choir chorus singing carols at night\nBut more than anything, there were gifts of kindness and the staff always went above and beyond to afford a private but luxurious stay.  Thank you to everyone who made our stay so absolutely magical.  We hope to be back, but if not, the memories of this holiday and the welcoming atmosphere of this beautiful hotel  will stay with us for a very long time.","time":"a week ago"},{"author":"lenswork4","rating":5,"text":"From check in to check out, this hotel is outstanding in every way! Staff are helpful and attentive at every turn. Our room was spacious and well-appointed with everything a guest might need from an excellent bed for sleeping to a desk and chair for writing or catching up on work. Bathroom contained upscale toiletries and plenty of them. Lots of outlets to plug in your electronic devices for sure or charging, and they are located at convenient spots around the room. Room was also very quiet with no noise from street or hallway, making it easy to sleep and relax. Location is close to some major cultural attractions including the Teatro Real, Royal Palace, Puerta del Sol, and Plaza Mayor. I highly recommend the “red level” experience because the lounge that includes breakfast, snacks, and drinks is a buffet of tasty delights and drinks to satisfy your cravings. I will stay here during my next visit to Madrid.","time":"a month ago"},{"author":"Chandima N Dayantha","rating":5,"text":"The location is great, walking distance to palace and other highlights.\nHotel staff was friendly, courteous- service was excellent (ie. Ritz-Carlton level).. From concierge to resturant staff to attendants/vallet, They went out of their way to adress every need. They even helped us with locating our lost baggage working with airport authorities since we werent fluent in Spanish and while we were out sight seeing. The club level \"red\" we had really came with open bar and special quiet areas for dining and was really worth it. Rooms were excellent even came with hair iron, steam iron and welcome fruit bowl etc. Attention to detail was amazing -even provided plugs that were compatible to American electrical items. These were truly appreciated since we didn''t have our checked baggage. Their free car service was also a pleasant surprise with English speaking drivers and limo type seating.\n\nRoof top had great views sunset or morning. Gym was well equipped.\n\nBut really the service of the staff puts this hotel at 6stars, unfortunately only 5stars available.","time":"3 weeks ago"},{"author":"B Lee","rating":5,"text":"We had a wonderful experience.  The staff is professional, friendly, and helpful.  We ate breakfast buffet and dinner twice at the hotel.    The food is fresh and delicious. I especially liked the breads that they bake daily, so delicious. The hotel was beautifully decorated for the Christmas Holiday.","time":"a week ago"},{"author":"Elana P","rating":5,"text":"We greatly enjoyed our stay at the Palacio de los Duques Gran Meliá Hotel. From the moment we arrived, we were treated with kindness and warmth from the hotel staff. The hotel is in a quieter area which was nice, but still very walkable to the main attractions. The hotel itself is beautiful and the room was comfortable. We really enjoyed the breakfast, it was delicious! Paula at the concierge was amazing and gave us a map of tapas restaurants to check out.\n\nWe would happily return next time we visit Madrid and highly recommend!","time":"a month ago"}]'::jsonb,

Incredible experience start to finish. Everyone was super nice and helpful. We even accidentally left behind some clothes and they found a way to get it to us at our next town in France. Highly recommend this hotel!!","time":"5 months ago"},{"author":"Familia BB","rating":3,"text":"We stayed here on 16th July for one night at the last minute. My brother made the booking as he is a frequent Marriott customer and had some way of doing so - when I had looked there was no room.\nOur stay was very pleasant. Our children were not put in an adjacent or interconnecting room as asked for and we were not able to receive an upgrade because it was a last minute booking - understood.\nThe frustrating part started at our check out. I paid the bill assuming that all was being charged. There was no breakdown of charges at all - just the final amount. I asked for the invoice to be sent to my email address but it has never arrived.\nThe hotel had charged 200€ extra on my card for expenses during our trip which I expected to be returned. Later they charged 29,95€ and a further 229,95€ on the card. We had invited a friend for breakfast so I presumed the 29,95€ was an extra breakfast charge.\nA few days later, nothing had been returned, so I called reception to enquire. Everyone was too busy, could I call later? I called again the next day. No one was available. They asked me to write an email. I wrote an email. No answer nor confirmation of the receipt of the email. I called again. The third time. Could someone please respond to me? I was told that they would. A few days passed. Yesterday I resent the email and added a few words about how frustrated I was that no one had deemed my query important enough to respond. I received a quick email informing me that breakfast wasn’t included and that I had been charged extra for them.\nWhy not prevent all of this wasted time and misunderstandings by showing me a detailed bill on checking out? I had to call 3 times and send two email for this very simple point to be clarified. What a waste of time and bitter end to what was a nice albeit expensive stay.","time":"4 months ago"}]'::jsonb,
