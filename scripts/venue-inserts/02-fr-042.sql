it’s a true fairytale experience filled with comfort, elegance, and genuine care. Every corner of the property is infused with attention to detail, from the impeccably designed interiors to the breathtaking natural surroundings.\nThe service is absolutely top-notch. Every request was met with such ease and promptness, it felt like the staff could anticipate our needs before we even voiced them. Special praise goes to the entire team: Alessia, Jordao and Emilie — incredibly responsive, kind, and discreet professionals who made us feel truly special.\nAnd of course, a heartfelt thank you to the director — a person with a big heart and a true talent for hospitality. Alessia was available 24/7, always ready to assist, support, organize, or offer advice. A remarkable professional and an absolute pleasure to deal with.\nThis was a getaway we’ll be talking about for a long time — filled with warm memories and the kind of magic that makes you want to return again and again. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for such an unforgettable experience!","time":"7 months ago"},{"author":"Sophie Spooner","rating":5,"text":"A very special and stunning place! We enjoyed several days here with friends old and new, celebrating a 50th birthday of a very dear friend, and it was just idyllic!

The rooms are spacious, renovated, and unique. The interiors of the chateau are tastefully decorated and truly make you feel royal.\n\nOur guests had such a lovely time relaxing and enjoying the property. Our wedding cocktail and reception were held in the gardens, where we could enjoy the view of the château. Being able to host 40 of our guests at the château was such a treat as it allowed us to spend time with loved ones who had traveled from afar to be with us on our special day.\n\nHowever, the cherry on top of our wedding experience at the château was, without a doubt, Valentina and Nicola.\nTheir kindness, support, and attention to detail are exactly what you are looking for when searching for a venue to celebrate a special occasion. Both of them made us feel welcomed, ensured we were comfortable, and checked in with us throughout our stay while giving us our space to enjoy the château.\n\nIf you are planning an event or just want to relax at a unique and extraordinary place, we highly recommend Château Villers-Bocage for its stunning property and the outstanding services provided by Valentina and Nicola. We are truly grateful for the exceptional experience we had at the château.\n\nValentina and Nicola, thank you once again for contributing to our special day and making it unforgettable!\n\nWe can''t wait to come back to the chateau!","time":"a year ago"},{"author":"Jennell Espitee","rating":5,"text":"Hosts Valentina and Nicola are amazing! The chateau was a fairytale! We had our wedding and stay at the chateau and it was absolutely perfect! We cannot describe how perfect this chateau was, there are no words! The grounds are spectacular, each room was beautifully different with an en suite bathroom that were updated and so clean! Any moment I needed to contact Valentina, she responded quickly and helped out beyond her means! Valentina and Nicola went above and beyond to make our stay and wedding a dream! Our event assistant Axelle also made this stay perfect! I cannot say a negative thing about staying at chateau Villers-Bocage! I would recommend this chateau to everyone! From the moment we arrived ( with a warm welcoming from the hosts) to the day we had to leave- this was a dream for all of us! Every guest had an amazing time! This is a wonderful location, with walking distance to the town and less than an hour from historical sites! They set up everything we wanted and needed! An added bonus- we had a golf cart to explore the massive and beautiful grounds! The kids and adults loved the goats, the indoor pool, hot tub, game room, cinema room, outdoor pool, tennis courts and golf range!
