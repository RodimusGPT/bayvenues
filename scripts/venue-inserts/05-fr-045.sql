With their expertise, alongside the wonderful Julie (Festidays Planner) we were able to fully relax and enjoy every moment.\n\nOur wedding was held over three days and many of our guests were able to stay in the accommodation which was really important to us when looking for a venue.  It was so wonderful to see different friendship groups and families getting to know each other, many guests that met at our wedding have kept in touch and meet up with each other now!\n\nThe wedding was mid October, it was warm and sunny but not too hot to be in the sun so we were able to make use of the beautiful olive grove for our ceremony.  Julien suggested we use the stretch tent above the courtyard in case it got colder in the evening and there were heaters available if needed.\n\nThank you so much to the whole team of Domaine de Valbonne, along with all our wonderful team of suppliers for giving us such a magical wedding. We wish we could do the whole thing again and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this venue to other couples planning their wedding.","time":"a year ago"},{"author":"Arnaud Waehlti","rating":5,"text":"Without hesitation a 5 STAR REVIEW!!!

The Domaine de Valbonne is the best of the best venue in Provence, and we had an incredible wedding weekend there in August 2023. The owners and caretakers, Julien, Estelle, and Victor take amazing care and attention to detail in everything to bring your wedding experience to the next level. They were present for any troubles the entire weekend and helped coordinate with the vendors, wedding planner, and the guests to ensure everything ran smoothly. In addition, the Domaine has a collection of beautifully restored old timer cars that the owners allowed us to have around for photos and use as an entrance into our wedding day dinner. We continue to think about the memories of our wedding weekend here fondly. We were so lucky to book this venue, and would highly recommend to anyone in search of a beautiful provencial wedding venue that can host people for an entire weekend.
